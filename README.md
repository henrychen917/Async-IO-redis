# Async-IO-redis

Generally the same as normal redis but persistence is handled with asychronous I/O compared to normal sychronous I/O.
This results in save times taken for big payload sizes to reduce significantly. For usage refer to https://redis.io/docs/
This Async-IO-redis isn't stable at the momemnt and was made purely for resaerch purposes
